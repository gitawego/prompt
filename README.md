# Simple Prompt
> Simple commandline prompt for Node.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qawemlilo/prompt.png)](https://travis-ci.org/qawemlilo/prompt)

While working on a Node.js automation tool I needed to generate some files and code after gathering a few details from the user. Most of the modules that I found were a bit of an over-kill, all I wanted was a good old prompt (like the browser type) so I wrote this module. 

### v0.2.0 API Changes
Version 0.2.0 breaks the 0.1.x API. If you want to use the old API please install v0.1.6.
The new version  allows you create multiple `simple-prompt` instances run independently.

### Installation

````
npm install simple-prompt 
````

### How to use

Simple prompt accepts an array of `question objects`

```javascript
var Prompt = require('simple-prompt');

var questions = [
    {
        question: 'Name',
        
        required: true, // required
        
        default: 'John' // default value,
        id:'myname' //define id
    },
    {
        question: 'Last Name' //optional,
        color:"green" //show label in green color
    },
    {
        question: 'Age',
        
        required: true, // required
        
        validate: function (answer) {
            return parseInt(answer, 10) >= 18; // only 18 or higher
        },
        
        filter: function (answer) {
            return parseInt(answer, 10); // bring back my answer as a number
        },
        
        default: 18 // default value
    }
];


var profile = new Prompt(questions);

profile.create().then(function (error, answers) {
  if (error) {
   return;
  }

  var name = answers.myname;
  var lastName = answers.LastName;
  var age = answers.Age;

  // Do something with values
});


var moreQuestions = [
    {
        question: 'Favourite Text Editor',
    },
    {
        question: 'Favourite OS',
    },
    {
        question: 'Favourite Beverage',
    }
];

var favourites = new Prompt(moreQuestions);

favourites.create().then(function (error, answers) {
  if (error) {
   return;
  }

  var editor = answers.FavouriteTextEditor;
  var os = answers.FavouriteOS;
  var beverage = answers.FavouriteBeverage;

  // Do something with values
});

### Question object
The `question object` has 4 properties that you can specify:

 - question (String)- label for your question and key for your answer.
 - default (String)- default value if answer is not given.
 - required (Boolean) - flag to indicated if input is required.
 - validate (Function) - a function that accepts a string and returns a boolean value after testing it.
 - filter (Function) - a function that accepts a string and returns it after doing operations on it.


### Methods
Simple-prompt only has 2 methods:

 - .create {Function} - Initializes the prompt and returns the main object
 - .then {Function}(callback {Function}) - Mimicks a promise callback method that accepts a function which takes 2 arguments, error and a return value, respectively.
 
### Testing
```
npm test
```
